#Interferometer readout 
We consider the following setup
$$H_{ifo}(t) = H_{0}+(a^\dagger + a)h(t)$$
Where $h(t)$ is the signal of interest and it is coupled to one quadrature of the interferometer mode.
This system is cascaded into our readout system, which consists of a series of filters, each one specified by a temporal mode function $\kappa$
At some final time $T$, we will trace out the interferometer and consider arbitrary measurements on the filters.
