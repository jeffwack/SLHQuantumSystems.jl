# Linear Quantum Networks

Linear quantum systems are open quantum systems that consist of harmonic
bosonic modes with quadratic Hamiltonians and linear couplings to external
fields. They are extensively studied in quantum optics, where they can describe
systems of optical resonators, beamsplitters, and quadratic optical
nonlinearity such as two-mode squeezing.

SLHQuantumSystems supports two equivalent descriptions of linear quantum systems.
